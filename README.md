# Pacman-Factory
- This HTML document creates an interactive Pac-Man animation.
- It includes two buttons: 
  - **"Add Pacman"** to create Pac-Man images.
  - **"Start Game"** to initiate movement.
- Pac-Man images are randomly positioned within a container.
- Each Pac-Man moves with random velocity and direction.
- The animation includes sprite changes based on movement direction.
- Collisions with container edges reverse Pac-Man's direction, creating a dynamic gameplay experience.
